jboss-migration

Program for migrating configuration of JBoss AS5 to JBoss AS7
(Still in development)

Application is migrating configuration of these subsystems:
- datasource
- logging
- resource-adapters
- security
- server(jboss-web / tomcat)

App creates Cli scripts and writes them on console output. App then tries to migrate AS5 XML configuration to its
representation in AS7 and apply it to defined standalone file.

This conversion also include copying files required for successful migration from AS5 directory to their right place in
AS7 home directory (drivers jars, resource-adapters, logging files, property files).

If migration fails (missing files, wrong configuration in AS5 etc.) then it rollbacks all changes made in AS7 home directory
and in selected standalone file.

Application best works on fresh AS7.

==Usage:==

java -jar AsMigration-1.0.jar  --as5.dir=<AS5path> --as7.dir=<AS7.path>  [<option>, ...]


Options:

    --as5.profile=<name>
        Path to AS 5 profile.
        Default: "default"

    --as7.confPath=<path>
        Path to AS 7 config file.
        Default: "standalone/configuration/standalone.xml"

    --conf.<module>.<property>=<value>  := Module-specific options.

        <module> := Name of one of modules. E.g. datasource, jaas, security, ...
        <property> := Name of the property to set. Specific per module. May occur multiple times.
      -> *This option doesn't have any effect at this moment. It will be implemented soon.*
